# Mock Apple Music Usage Log

This file tracks all usage of mock Apple Music infrastructure.

Rules:
- Append-only
- One entry per change
- Each entry must include:
  - File path
  - Responsibility
  - Phase / Block
  - Env flag
  - Revert instruction

## 2026-02-10 — Phase 8 / Block 0 — Apple Catalog search fixtures
- File path: backend/providers/apple/mock/data/search-success.json
- File path: backend/providers/apple/mock/data/search-empty.json
- File path: backend/providers/apple/mock/data/search-error.json
- File path: backend/providers/apple/mock/data/pagination-page-2.json
- Responsibility: Populate Apple-shaped mock Apple Music Catalog search payloads for Phase 8 verification.
- Phase / Block: Phase 8 / Block 0
- Env flag: APPLE_PROVIDER_MODE=mock
- Revert instruction: Delete the four JSON fixture files above (or reset `backend/providers/apple/mock/data/` to its previous state).

## 2026-02-10 — Phase 8 / Block 0 — Mock provider + gating
- File path: backend/providers/apple/mock/MockAppleMusicProvider.js
- File path: backend/providers/apple/mock/MockAppleMusicProvider.ts
- File path: backend/providers/ProviderRegistry.js
- Responsibility: Implement a MockAppleMusicProvider (raw Apple-shaped fixture payloads) and gate provider selection strictly by APPLE_PROVIDER_MODE.
- Phase / Block: Phase 8 / Block 0
- Env flag: APPLE_PROVIDER_MODE=mock
- Revert instruction: Set APPLE_PROVIDER_MODE=real; mock provider will no longer be used. No code removal required.

## 2026-02-10 — Phase 9 / Block 9.5 — Frontend mock playback engine wiring
- File path: frontend/src/playback/mock/MockPlaybackEngine.ts
- File path: frontend/src/context/playback/PlaybackContext.tsx
- Responsibility: Mock playback wiring (discrete-only state transitions) gated by PLAYBACK_MODE=mock to validate playback state flow + UI reactions without audio, timers, or MusicKit.
- Phase / Block: Phase 9 / Block 9.5
- Env flag: PLAYBACK_MODE=mock
- Revert instruction: Delete `frontend/src/playback/mock/MockPlaybackEngine.ts` and remove the PLAYBACK_MODE mock engine delegation from `frontend/src/context/playback/PlaybackContext.tsx` (restore direct dispatch or replace with real MusicKit engine in Block 9.7).
